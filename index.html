      <h1> FAQ:</h1>
                      <h4>When did you start coding?</h4>
                      <p>- Started coding around <strong><em>May 13, 2022</em></strong></p>
                      <h4>Where did you started coding and What first language did you start with?</h4>
                      <p>- Mostly at youtube and learning about python but It was hard and confusing at the same time then I discovered 
                        freecodecamp and started learning HTML </p>
                      <h4>Why do you like programming?</h4>
                      <p>- Because It's related to a computer. I would like to develop softwares, apps or AI's even creating websites
